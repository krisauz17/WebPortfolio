        <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
        <p>For past couple of weeks I have worked on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have counter numbers of issues while
            testing the scripts, design and documents on website, questioning my self to make the website more
            interactive and responsive to the end users thus encouraging me to come up with my own thoughts and
            solutions to built a website from scratch. then learning more options on design, scripts and markup
            languages build up my confidence that I will be able to do a job as a front end developer. Although I do
            have fare knowledge in the frontend applications and tools as I have work on web technologies before and
            build couple of website for businesses.</p>
